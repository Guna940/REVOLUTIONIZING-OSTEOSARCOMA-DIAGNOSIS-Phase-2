**REVOLUTIONIZING OSTEOSARCOMA DIAGNOSIS: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR PRECISE BONE CANCER DETECTION USING MULTI-MODAL MEDICAL IMAGING**

## About
Osteosarcoma, a highly aggressive primary bone malignancy, poses a sig-nificant challenge to public health, necessitating precise and timely diagnos-tic solutions. This study delves deep into the realm of sophisticated deep learning models tailored specifically for the meticulous detection of osteo-sarcoma, leveraging diverse multi-modal medical imaging datasets. Through a meticulous comparative analysis, we rigorously scrutinize the performance of cutting-edge algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Mo-bileNetV2 architecture, a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the U-Net model. Our evaluation metrics, meticulously examining accu-racy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offer a detailed insight into the diagnos-tic capabilities of each model. Among these, our custom CNN emerges as a frontrunner, showcasing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in reshaping the landscape of osteosarcoma diagnosis. This research not only propels the discourse on the application of deep learning but also under-scores the pivotal role of state-of-the-art technology in enhancing the preci-sion and efficacy of bone cancer detection methodologies. With an accuracy of 72%, our CNN surpasses other models, including MobileNetV2 (76%), U-Net (85%), and an enhanced CNN designed for binary classification (95%). This highlights the significant strides made by deep learning, particularly in advancing the accuracy and reliability of osteosarcoma diagnosis.

## Results and Impact
In summary, our investigation into osteosarcoma diagnosis through advanced deep learning models—custom CNNs, MobileNetV2, and U-Net—has yielded promising outcomes. Achieving a notable 95% accu-racy in binary CNN classification demonstrates the efficacy of these models. Beyond numerical performance metrics, the study emphasizes the transformative potential in clinical diagnostics, offering nuanced insights into bone cancer manifestation. Utilizing modern methodolo-gies, including Apeer.io for segmentation and SVM for diverse model architectures, the study employs rigorous evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a detailed un-derstanding of the models' proficiency in distinguishing tumor and non-tumor regions.As we navigate the complexities of medical image analysis, these findings highlight the potential of deep learning para-digms to enhance precision in osteosarcoma diagnosis. Integration into clinical workflows holds significant promise for improving patient care and outcomes. This study serves as a catalyst for further explora-tion, marking a pivotal step toward revolutionizing bone cancer detec-tion.
